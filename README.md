# RainProperty
Project to extract rainfall properties from isolated rain streak images

ReadImage.py contains read a matlab generated .mat file of isolated rainstreak.
RainProperty.py calculates the rainfall properties such as streak length, drop velocity and rain rate. etc.
test.py shows how to implement this simple work.

With the graph, it marks those detected rain drop.


This work done by the inspiration of the paper: Toward the camera rain gauge. Autor: P.Allamano, A. Croci, and F.Laio
